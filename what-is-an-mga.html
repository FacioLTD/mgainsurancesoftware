                <p>A <strong>Managing General Agent (MGA)</strong> is a specialized insurance intermediary that operates with <strong>delegated authority</strong> from one or more insurers. Unlike a standard broker, an MGA can:</p>
                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li>Underwrite risks</li>
                    <li>Bind coverage</li>
                    <li>Issue policies and endorsements</li>
                    <li>Price business using agreed rating models</li>
                    <li>Often handle claims and other back-office functions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In other words, an MGA performs functions that would normally be done by the insurer itself.</p>
                <p>Legal or regulatory definitions typically emphasize:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>An MGA is "appointed by an underwriting insurer to solicit applications… and, if authorized, to effectuate and countersign insurance contracts," often including underwriting, policy issuance, premium collection, and reporting.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>MGAs may also be called:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MGUs (Managing General Underwriters)</strong> – often similar but with more emphasis on underwriting than distribution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Program Administrators / Program Managers</strong> – especially in US program business.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 id="value-chain-heading">2. Where MGAs Sit in the Insurance Value Chain</h2>
                <p>Think of the traditional distribution chain like this:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Insurer (carrier) → Wholesaler / MGA → Retail broker → Insured</strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Unlike standard agents or brokers (who arrange coverage but don't underwrite), MGAs occupy a <strong>hybrid role</strong>:</p>
                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li>They have <strong>front-line underwriting authority</strong> (within agreed parameters).</li>
                    <li>They manage <strong>distribution</strong> through brokers, agents, digital channels, or direct.</li>
                    <li>They often <strong>design products</strong> and build niche expertise in specific segments (e.g., construction, sports, cyber, marine).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>For carriers, MGAs provide:</h3>
                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li>Access to niche segments and specialist underwriting talent</li>
                    <li>Local presence in markets where the carrier has no physical operations</li>
                    <li>Variable cost structure (commission-based rather than fixed overhead)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>For brokers and insureds, MGAs provide:</h3>
                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li>Faster answers from empowered underwriters</li>
                    <li>Tailored products and wordings</li>
                    <li>Capacity from multiple carriers through one specialist channel</li>

                <article class="criterion">
                    <h3>3.1 MGA vs Retail Broker</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>retail broker</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Represents the insured (client)</li>
                        <li>Shops coverage with carriers/MGAs</li>
                        <li>Earns commission from premium placed</li>
                        <li>Cannot normally underwrite or bind on their own authority</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An <strong>MGA</strong>:</p>
                    <ul class="benefits-list">
                        <li>Represents the <strong>insurer(s)</strong> for underwriting purposes</li>
                        <li>Has delegated authority to <strong>underwrite and bind</strong></li>
                        <li>Can issue policies and endorsements</li>
                        <li>May or may not distribute directly to retail clients</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So while both are intermediaries, the MGA has <strong>insurer-like authority</strong>, whereas a broker has <strong>customer-facing advisory</strong> responsibilities.</p>
                </article>
                
                <article class="criterion">
                    <h3>3.2 MGA vs Insurer (Carrier)</h3>
                    <p>An MGA is <strong>not</strong> an insurer:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It usually doesn't hold the risk capital itself.</li>
                        <li>It writes business <strong>on behalf of</strong> insurers and reinsurers.</li>
                        <li>It is compensated via commission, profit share, and/or fees.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, a mature MGA will look very "carrier-like" operationally:</p>
                    <ul class="benefits-list">
                        <li>Product design</li>
                        <li>Underwriting guidelines</li>
                        <li>Claims oversight (sometimes handling)</li>
                        <li>Compliance and reporting</li>
                        <li>Data & portfolio management</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is why <strong><a href="/pas-buyers-checklist.html">MGA software and PAS requirements</a></strong> are closer to a carrier core system than a simple broker CRM.</p>

                <h2 id="da-heading">5. Delegated Authority: The Core of the MGA Model</h2>
                <p>At the heart of the MGA concept is <strong>delegated authority</strong>: the insurer outsources some or all of the following to the MGA under a contract:</p>
                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li>Product design (within guidelines)</li>
                    <li>Underwriting & rating</li>
                    <li>Binding and issuance</li>
                    <li>Premium collection</li>
                    <li>Bordereaux and regulatory reporting</li>
                    <li>Claims handling or at least FNOL & triage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is governed by a <strong>Delegated Authority Agreement</strong>, often called:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Binding Authority (Lloyd's context)</li>
                    <li>Program Administration Agreement</li>
                    <li>Delegated Underwriting Agreement</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These contracts specify:</p>
                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li>Lines of business & territories</li>
                    <li>Underwriting criteria and exclusions</li>
                    <li>Limits, aggregates, and line sizes</li>
                    <li>Pricing/rating models and referral rules</li>
                    <li>Documentation and wording requirements</li>
                    <li>Reporting frequency and bordereaux formats</li>
                    <li>Audit, oversight, and performance targets</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because the MGA acts "as the insurer" within these parameters, regulators and rating agencies expect <strong>carrier-grade controls</strong> around:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data</li>
                    <li>Process</li>

                    <li>Systems & controls</li>
